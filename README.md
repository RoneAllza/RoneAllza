# 👋 Hi, I'm RoneAllza!

I'm a backend developer who thrives on solving problems and building robust applications, usually with **Laravel**. Lately, I've been deploying with **Laravel Octane** for that extra boost in performance 🚀. I love keeping my code clean and efficient, often using the **Blade templating engine** to craft elegant UIs.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

- **Profession:** Backend Programmer (mostly Laravel, but always ready to learn and adapt)
- **Current Focus:** Deploying with Laravel Octane, optimizing backend performance
- **Favorite Tool:** Blade templating engine
- **Favorite Repo:** My final task assignment — co-developed with [@ryanmoehs](https://github.com/ryanmoehs). It was a fun and rewarding collaboration!
- **Coding Style:** Lazy, but easily motivated. I believe in smart work over hard work. If there's a shortcut (the right way!), I'll find it 😄.

## 🏃‍♂️ Hobbies

When I'm not coding, you'll find me speed reading novels. I love getting lost in stories and learning from different worlds and perspectives. And also, an avid KAF listener.

## 💡 Fun Fact

I might be a self-proclaimed lazy coder, but that just means I'm always looking for the most efficient (and sometimes clever) solutions!
